                            <p>The Harvard Art Museums are comprised of three separate museums—the Fogg Museum,
                                Busch-Reisinger Museum, and Arthur M. Sackler Museum—each with a different history,
                                collection, guiding philosophy, and identity.</p><br><br>
                        </div>
                        <div class="boxs box_2">
                            <h3>Fogg Museum</h3>
                            <p>The Fogg Museum opened in 1895 on the northern edge of Harvard Yard in a modest
                                Beaux-Arts
                                building designed by Richard Morris Hunt, twenty-one years after the President and
                                Fellows
                                of Harvard College appointed Charles Eliot Norton the first professor of art history
                                in
                                America. It was made possible when, in 1891, Mrs. Elizabeth Fogg gave a gift in
                                memory of
                                her husband to build “an Art Museum to be called and known as the William Hayes Fogg
                                Museum
                                of Harvard College.” In 1927, the Fogg Museum moved to its home at 32 Quincy Street.
                                <br />
                                Designed by architects Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch, and Abbott of Boston, the joint
                                art
                                museum and teaching facility was the first purpose-built structure for the
                                specialized
                                training of art scholars, conservators, and museum professionals in North America.
                                With an
                                early collection that consisted largely of plaster casts and photographs, the Fogg
                                Museum is
                                now renowned for its holdings of Western paintings, sculpture, decorative arts,
                                photographs,
                                prints, and drawings dating from the Middle Ages to the present.

                            <h3>Busch-Reisinger Museum</h3>
                            <p>The Busch-Reisinger Museum was founded in 1901 as the Germanic Museum. Unique among
                                North
                                American museums, the Busch-Reisinger is dedicated to the study of all modes and
                                periods of
                                art from central and northern Europe, with an emphasis on German-speaking countries.
                                In 1921
                                the Germanic Museum moved to Adolphus Busch Hall, built partly with funds from
                                Adolphus
                                Busch’s son-in-law, Hugo Reisinger, and in 1950 it was renamed the Busch-Reisinger
                                Museum.
                                The museum moved again in 1991, this time to Werner Otto Hall at 32 Quincy Street,
                                designed
                                by Gwathmey Siegel & Associates. Adolphus Busch Hall continues to house the founding
                                collection of plaster casts of medieval art and is the venue for concerts on its
                                world-renowned Flentrop pipe organ, while the Busch-Reisinger Museum’s holdings
                                include
                                significant works of Austrian Secession art, German expressionism, 1920s
                                abstraction, and
                                materials related to the Bauhaus. Other strengths include late-medieval sculpture
                                and
                                eighteenth-century art. The museum also holds noteworthy postwar and contemporary
                                art from
                                German-speaking Europe.</p><br>
                            <h3>Arthur M. Sackler Museum</h3>
                            <p>In 1912, Langdon Warner taught the first courses in Asian art at Harvard, and the
                                first at
                                any American university. By 1977, Harvard’s collections of Asian, ancient, and
                                Islamic and
                                later Indian art had grown sufficiently in size and importance to require a larger
                                space for
                                their display and study. With the generosity of Dr. Arthur M. Sackler, a leading
                                psychiatrist, entrepreneur, art collector, and philanthropist, the Harvard Art
                                Museums
                                founded a museum dedicated to works from Asia, the Middle East, and the
                                Mediterranean. The
                                Arthur M. Sackler Museum, a new museum building at 485 Broadway designed by James
                                Stirling,
                                opened in 1985. This structure remains the home of the History of Art and

                            <h3>Renovation and Expansion</h3>
                            <p>The Harvard Art Museums’ recent renovation and expansion builds on the legacies of
                                these
                                three museums and unites their remarkable collections under one roof for the first
                                time.
                                Renzo Piano Building Workshop’s responsive design preserved the Fogg Museum’s
                                landmark 1927
                                facility, while transforming the space to accommodate twenty-first-century needs.
                                <br><br />
                                Following a six-year building project, the museums now feature 40 percent more
                                gallery
                                space, an expanded Art Study Center, conservation labs, and classrooms, and a
                                striking new
                                glass roof that bridges the facility’s historic and contemporary architecture.
                                <br><br />
                                In line with Harvard’s commitment to sustainability, the museums’ renovation and
                                expansion
                                achieved LEED Gold certification for incorporating a wide range of green building
                                technologies including, energy efficient LED bulbs and an innovative water
                                conservation
                                system. The new Harvard Art Museums’ building is more functional, accessible,
                                spacious, and
                                above all, more transparent. The three constituent museums retain their distinct
                                identities
                                in this new facility, yet their close proximity provides exciting opportunities to
                                experience works of art in a broader context.
